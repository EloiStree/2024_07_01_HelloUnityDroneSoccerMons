# All in one XR or Git Branches XR ?

You can try to use Open XR and make a game for all platform...
But that quickly become a mess to managed because of the SDK auto-setting.

A solution that is a pain in the ass and eat lot's of time:
- Toolboxes everywhere
- Git Branches/Fork for every headset per project
  - Per year (because SDK change every 6 months)
